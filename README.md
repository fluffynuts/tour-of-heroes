# TourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

However, after that, it was updated to use an internally-installed
`ng`, so commands from here on out will differ slightly.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload 
if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run ng -- generate component component-name` to generate a 
new component. You can also use `npm run ng -- generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be 
stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build, ie `npm run build -- --prod`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests _once_ via 
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Run `npm run autotest`
to run tests in continuous mode.

## Linting
Run `npm run lint` to lint the main and e2e projects
and fix all fixable errors. Run `npm run autolint` to
keep the linter refreshing whilst you're fixing issues.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via 
[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
